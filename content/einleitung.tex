\chapter{Introduction} \label{chp:einleitung}

The XXX is a client-server system communicating over an CAN interface. The XXX
is the client which gets input from buttons and switches, displays the action
on an LCD and sends information over to the server.

\section{About the Hardware}%
\label{sec:About the Hardware}

The hardware is based on an tqma335x module which uses an TI am335x
microcontroller. Refer to \cite[TQ product website]{tqam335x} and
\cite[TI am335x manual]{tiam335x} to get more information.


\section{About the Linux Kernel}%
\label{sec:About the Linux Kernel}

A mainline Linux kernel version 4.4.39 is running on this hardware. This kernel
version is compatible to the last release of BSP packed version 119 supporting
the last revision 2.2.3 of the tqma335x module. The used \ac{BSP} was released
in Dezember 2019. To be compatible to this BSP was the reason choosing this
kernel version and not a Linux kernel 5.x.
\\
Some changes were made to the Linux mainline Kernel like replacing the DRM video
drivers to get the LCD running according to the TI errata \cite{am335_errata} as
well as changes in the Kernel configuration.
\\
The howl changes made to mainline kernel provided by the TQ BSP packet Version
119 \cite{tq_bsp119} are described during the following chapters inside this
document.
