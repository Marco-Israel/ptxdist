The control panel (CP) for the Telair cargo loading system is a client-server
system communicating over an CAN interface. The control panel
is the client which gets input from buttons and switches, displays the action
on an LCD and sends information over to the server. On the client system an
Linux system is running, interating beween User input and handels the tasks.
to be preformed. Only the client system from the Software side is descript in
this document.

\section{About the Linux Kernel}%
\label{sec:About the Linux Kernel}

A mainline \textbf{Linux kernel version 4.4.39} is running on this hardware.
This kernel version is compatible to the last release of \textbf{\gls{BSPacr}
packet version 119} supporting the last \textbf{tqma335x module revision 2.2.3.}
The used \gls{BSP} was released in Dezember 2019. To be compatible to this
BSP was the reason choosing this kernel version and not a current Linux kernel
like 5.x.

Some changes were made to the Linux mainline Kernel like replacing the DRM video
drivers to get the LCD running according to the TI errata
\cite{TI_am335x_errata} as well as changes in the Kernel configuration. \\

The howl changes made to mainline kernel provided by the TQ BSP packet version
119 \cite{tq_bsp119} are described during the following chapters inside this
document. \textbf{Thats what this document is about}.
