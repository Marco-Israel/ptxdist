\section{About the Linux Kernel}%
\label{sec:About the Linux Kernel}

A mainline Linux kernel version 4.4.39 is running on this hardware. This kernel
version is compatible to the last release of BSP packed version 119 supporting
the last revision 2.2.3 of the tqma335x module. The used \ac{BSP} was released
in Dezember 2019. To be compatible to this BSPi, was the reason choosing this
kernel version and not a current Linux kernel 5.x.
\\
Some changes were made to the Linux mainline Kernel like replacing the DRM video
drivers to get the LCD running according to the TI errata
\cite{TI_am335x_errata} as well as changes in the Kernel configuration.
\\
The howl changes made to mainline kernel provided by the TQ BSP packet version
119 \cite{tq_bsp119} are described during the following chapters inside this
document. Thats what this document is about.
