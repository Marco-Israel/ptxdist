\chapter{Patched and modified files}%
\label{cha:Patched and modified files}
There are a lot of patches to the Linux kernel, bootloader and other software
consonances which are already provided and integrated into PTXdist by the
used BSP \cite{BSP_119}. This should work out of the box. No chances are needed
here so this patches are not described here.
\\
Nevertheless some additional patches are needed to get the software and the
hardware running used by the Telair International GmbH. This is what this
chapter describes - the patches added by Telair additionally to the TQ patches.

\section{How to create a patch and integrate it into PTXdist?}%
\label{sec:How to create a patch and integrate it into PTXdist?}

Patches and modified files by Telair International GmbH are unter GIT version
control in an local repository. This documents what is done additionally
by Telair to the clean BSP from TQ. The repository is not uploaded yet outside
the virtualBox. Not or not manual modified files are in the .gitignore list an
so not under local version control. How to use GIT version control refer to
\cite[GIT howto]{git_howto}. To get more information about whats GIT and why to
use it, refer to \cite[GIT Homepage]{git_homepage}.

    \item[Patching process in PTX dist]
        To learn how patching process work in PTXdist refer to \cite{todo}
    \item[GNU-Tools \textit{diff},  \textit{patch} \textit{merge}] To get an
        introduction of the general Linux patching process using
        standard GNU-Tools, take a look at
        \cite[GNU Diff and Patch]{GNUPatchTools:Patch_Diff_Exaples} and
        \cite[GNU Merge]{GNUPatchTools:Merge_Examples}. Also take a look at the
        Linux manual pages in section 1:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item man 1 patch
            \item man 1 diff
            \item man 1 merge
        \end{itemize}
