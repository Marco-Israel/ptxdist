\chapter{Introduction}\label{chp:einleitung}
The control panel (CP) of the Telair International GmbH cargo loading system is
an client-server system communicating over an CAN interface. The control panel
is the client which gets input from buttons and switches, displays the action on
an LCD and sends information over to the server. On the client system an Linux
system is running, iterating between User input and handles the tasks  to be
preformed.  Only the client system from the Software side is descried in this
document.

\section{About the Linux Kernel}%\label{sec:About the Linux Kernel}

A mainline \textbf{Linux kernel version 4.4.39} is running on this hardware.
This kernel version is compatible to the last release of \textbf{\gls{BSP}
packet version 119} supporting the last \textbf{tqma335x module revision 2.2.3.}
The used \gls{BSP} was released in Dezember 2019. To be compatible to this
BSP was the reason choosing this kernel version and not a current Linux kernel
like 5.x.

Some changes were made to the Linux mainline Kernel like replacing the \gls{DRM}
video drivers to get the LCD running according to the TI
errata~\cite{TI_am335x_errata} as well as changes in the Kernel configuration.

The howl changes made to mainline kernel provided by the TQ BSP packet version
119~\cite{tq_bsp119} are described during the following chapters inside this
document. \textbf{That is what this document is about}.
