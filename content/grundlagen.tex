    \item[To build the Linux distribution] the framework \textit{PTXdist} is
        used. Refer to \cite{PTXdist} to get an introduction to PTXdist.
    \item[How to install PTXdist] and get the framework running, refer to
        \cite{install_ptxdist}. This describes how to install the
        \textbf{right cross compiler version} as well as how to configure
        PTXdist and the BSP, provided by TQ \cite[TQ BSP]{BSP_119}. Its
        important that the cross compiler is compatible to the used Linux kernel
        as well as the other sources provided by the BSP and PTXdist
        \textit{rules} (some kind of medadata describing how and were to
        download and install some sources and packets).
    \item[How to use PTXdist] refer to \cite[PTXdist manual]{ptxdist_manual}
